# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains various Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithmic exercises. It serves as a learning resource and a practice ground for mastering core Computer Science concepts.

## Contents

- **Stack Implementations**
  - `stack.java`: Basic array-based stack implementation.
  - `StackLinkedList.java`: Stack implemented using a linked list.
  - `CallStack.java`: Simulates call stack behavior using stack structure.

- **Queue Implementations**
  - `Queue.java`: Basic array-based queue implementation.
  - `QueueLinkedList.java`: Queue implemented using a linked list.

- **Linked Lists**
  - `singlyLinkedList.java`: Singly linked list operations.
  - `DoublyLinkedList.java`: Doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal.

- **Expression Evaluation**
  - `InfixToPostFix.java`: Converts infix expressions to postfix notation.
  - `Evaluation.java`: Evaluates postfix expressions.

- **Assignments**
  - `Assament.java`: A Java file possibly related to a programming assignment.
  - `LabAssignment.java`: Contains solutions or implementations for lab exercises.

- **Main Driver**
  - `Main.java`: Main file to run and test the different modules.
